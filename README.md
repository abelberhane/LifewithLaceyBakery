# Life with Lacey Bakery

This is a fun HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap project that I will be working on in my spare time. The website is modeled after a fictitious 
bakery. I am in the early design stages of this website and working with mock ups for the first time. Currently the first stage
of the mockup has been designed and you can find it below. 

While I begin working with HTML/CSS/JS more I will change the site design over time. I am starting with a version of another site that I 
have worked with and can not wait to keep adding more unique html elements and functions to this site.

**Update - 10/25 - Issues with floating the form/Image. 

MOCKUP of Website. The below images are a mockup of what I will be aiming to achieve.
